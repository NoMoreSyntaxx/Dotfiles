# Dotfiles
My Hyprland Dotfiles

These are my Hyprland dotfiles. I DO NOT recommend using my hyprland.conf . The keybinds are confusing and I use different plugins.

If you DO choose to use my hyprland.conf you will need following plugins:

Hy3
Hyprbars
Hyprexpo

I believe Hyprbars and Hyprexpo can be installed through the hyprpm packages manager.
I am not so sure about Hy3 though.

# How to Install 

Just to repeat, If you are going to use my hyprland.conf you need

Hy3
Hyprbars
Hyprexpo

Non-Hyprland apps:

kitty,
tofi,
waybar,

Can be installed by executing the following commando con

* On Arch:  
```sudo pacman -s kitty waybar && yay -S tofi```

( I have to test on more distros for now just try stuff using ur package manager please qwq )

- EDIT RIGHT HERE -
- tkinter must be installed for python.
- that's basically it thx!
- 
Now just place all of the folders to the home directory and merge all folders and files (use a file explorer)

The dots should be installed now!
