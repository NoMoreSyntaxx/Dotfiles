# Dotfiles
My Hyprland Dotfiles

These are my Hyprland dotfiles. I DO NOT recommend using my hyprland.conf . The keybinds are confusing and I use different plugins.

If you DO choose to use my hyprland.conf you will need following plugins:

Hy3
Hyprbars
Hyprexpo

I believe Hyprbars and Hyprexpo can be installed through the hyprpm packages manager.
I am not so sure about Hy3 though.

# How to Install 

Just to repeat, If you are going to use my hyprland.conf you need

Hy3
Hyprbars
Hyprexpo

And by me styled apps:

kitty
tofi
